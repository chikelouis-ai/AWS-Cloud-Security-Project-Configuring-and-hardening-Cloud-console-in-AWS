AWS - Cloud Security Project: Configuring and hardening Cloud console in AWS

Project Overview I completed this project on cloud security controls in Amazon Web Services (AWS), focusing on Identity and Access Management (IAM). The goal is to create a least privilege policy, attach it to a user group, and verify that the policy correctly restricts actions on two Amazon EC2 instances (customer service and Audit).

Tools & Concepts

● AWS IAM – users, groups, policies, account alias

● Amazon EC2 – instance tagging and lifecycle actions

● JSON policy syntax – Effect, Action, Resource

● Principle of least privilege and policy testing
